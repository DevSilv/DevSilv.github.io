## Copyright note

Note that this project "silvuss-thoughts" (this repository) has currently **no license**, as explained in [this GitHub guide on licensing projects](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).

For your convenience, I am including below a quote from that site:

> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

Also note that I can add a license in the future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## Disclaimers

Although I have made efforts to make the website (that this project contains) work as intended and described, it is not a "professional" website. Specifically, it was not tested in terms of separate unit tests or similar. It was tested to build on one platform. For details on the platform, see the section "[Environment, tools and technologies used](#environment-tools-and-technologies-used)" below.
