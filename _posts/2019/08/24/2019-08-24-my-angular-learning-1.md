This post is the first in the series "My learning of Angular".

This series is an english version of the series that I have started on [my microblog](https://4programmers.net/Profile/64311/Microblog) on the forum https://4programmers.net/. This version is slightly changed also beside the language; some information out-of-date was updated, and some information related strictly to that blog was removed. The main shape and the main content remain the same.

## My learning of Angular, part 1

Long time ago I have planned to learn **[Angular](https://angular.io/) basics**, but until this time I could not get onto it seriously.

So, I thought that I should change the way of learning. Instead of processing all the new information by myself, I decided to describe it somewhere publicly. A blog should be a good place.

First things first.

### The plan of the work

As in every undertaking, the plan is an important thing. So I plan: I will describe my whole learning in a couple of blog posts. Since I am going to learn the basics, it would be best not to plan how many posts and time shall it take (because I do not know the subject). However, no exact guidelines could cause chaos, what could cause productivity loss, what could cause me to abandon the whole idea. Making no effort for planning is not worth such a risk.

So, let us try to plan. I plan the following parts:
- Part 1 (this one): the plan + finding the main sources of materials. I will update the list in case I would need another source.
- The next part: the basics of the basics.
- The next part: most important problems that I will encounter. Since I am quite acquainted to JavaScript, I shall be able to asses, which ones.
- The next part: most interesting problems that I will encounter (unless I would not encounter any interesting).
- The next part (and possibly additional ones): all what did not fit in the previous parts.

(I have created this list in 5 minutes; be forgiving, please).

I will try to write the posts in the way that they will contain several short sections (like this post); in every section, there should be several short paragraphs (like in this post).

**I do not plan to publish the posts regularly.**

### Issues that could pose problems while learning and writing about it at the same time

#### Time

Time should not make serious problems. I usually procrastinate doing my duties, doing hundreds different unecessary things. So, since I have enough time to procrastinate, then I might try to make something useful instead – for example, to type.

#### Concentration

Concentration shall not make more problems than until now, learning in a different way. Because – until this time I have not been learning anything at all (well, of Angular), I have just been soldiering. If I would also soldier writing the posts, at least it will not make a difference.

#### Chaos

This will be the real problem. By "chaos", I mean not understanding what I will write about (because the assumption is that I understand what I write about). This happens frequently. How to avoid it – I do not know yet... `<scratching at head>`

#### Writing style

Maybe I will at least learn how to create shorter sentences (until now, I have not been writing series of posts; I am more practised at writing poetry, but there, sentences are not obligatory).

### My methodology for writing posts, and for working in general

The bulk of the posts' text will have Markdown syntax (as in other posts on this blog). Occasionally, I will put commands to execute in the terminal and code; in particular:
- The commands will be to be executed on Linux, distribution: Fedora, Fedora's version: 29 64-bit, shell: Bash.
- The code may be written in different languages, but I assume that I will use JavaScript and TypeScript the most.

#### A quick FAQ

1. **Will the posts be educational?** — No, I do not aim at learning anybody anything; but, if anybody would like to learn – help yourself.

2. **Are you practiced at programming/web programming/JavaScript programming?** — I know at least a little about each of these disciplines; for details, see [my GitHub account](https://github.com/devsilv) or other posts on this blog.

3. **Do you accept feature requests (i.e., suggestions), when it comes to the content of the posts from this series?** — No; I will decide myself what I am going to write about. Of course, you may suggest things in the comments.

4. **I have noticed a typo/a mistake in your post...** — Great! Do not hesitate to write about it in a comment. I really like to fix typos and mistakes in a text, including mine. :) (This is not a joke).

5. **I cannot be sure whether something in a post is a joke or not...** — Most probably, it is not. My sense of humour usually fluctuate nearby zero (rarely, there might occur deviations).

If you have any questions or comments about the posts, write about them in the comments.

Let's get started.

### Finding and selecting the sources of materials

Info: I am able to find the sources of materials because until now, I have known Angular enough to know **what** it is.

It is hard for me to choose materials because they are mostly interactive (that is, they require a second activity, beside reading), and I dislike it. Because of that, the most obvious choice – that is, [Angular's website](strona domowa Angulara](https://angular.io/) – is at a further place on the list of materials.

The second most obvious choice is for me, for a long time, Wikipedia (the English version is first).

- Source 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
- Source 2: https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Strona_g%C5%82%C3%B3wna

The third most obvious choice, when it comes to programming, has been for me, for a long time, the [StackExchange family of sites](https://stackexchange.com/). In the case of Angular, the appropariate site will be, most probably, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/); but, it will be useful to search other sites, too.

- Source 3: https://stackexchange.com/

The fourth most obvious choice in programming has been for me, for a long time, [GitHub](https://github.com/). I am aware that the learning materials that I can find there are mostly interactive, but I count on that in this case it will not be so bad.

- Source 4: https://github.com/

Further sources could be put in more or less random order, because I find them by typing the key word "angular" in Google, and I write the results in the same order:

- Source 5: https://www.w3schools.com/angular/
- Source 6: https://blog.angularindepth.com/
- Source 7: http://www.angular.love/

And, at the end:

- Source 8: https://angular.io/

I think that that should be enough. As I have mentioned, I will update the list in case I would need another source. Also, in case of some topics and posts, I could not utilize some of the main sources, if: 1) a source would be going to tell me nothing interesting in a topic or any of the topics of a particular post; or, 2) I would have already known everything from a topic or the post would be complete.

## Recapitulation

In this part, I have prepared the plan for my learning, and have describe the list of sources of the materials. In the next part, according to the plan, I will try to describe my learning the basics of the basics.

I hope that this all is going to work. All in all, this post spurred me into action. See you around!
