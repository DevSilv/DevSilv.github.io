This post is the second in the series "My learning of Angular".

This series is an english version of the series that I have started on [my microblog](https://4programmers.net/Profile/64311/Microblog) on the forum https://4programmers.net/. This version is slightly changed also beside the language; some information out-of-date was updated, and some information related strictly to that blog was removed. The main shape and the main content remain the same.

## My learning of Angular, part 2. Sources and materials

This part is to contain the sources and materials that I have used during my learning of Angular. Also, it may contain some sources and materials that I have not strictly "used", but that I find all the same to be helpful.

**Glossary**

- A "source" – usually a set of materials, sometimes a set of sources. Most of the elements of the set are directly related to my learning; the elements may be related between themselves. A given source, beside materials or sources related directly to my learning, may also contains materials related indirectly to my learning; among others, they may be libraries, examples, patterns, templates, software etc.
- A "material" – a material directly or indirectly related to my learning; it is more or less a consistent whole. It is an HTML document with; its content is usually "static", occasionally "dynamic" (e.g., utilizing the AJAX technology). If a given material is followed by a single date (`{month} {year}`), the date denotes the time of creation of, publication of or starting the material (if it is a thread); if a given material is followed by two dates (`{month} {year} – {month} {year}`), they denotes the period from the time of creation of (publication of, starting) the material to the time of the last edition of it, or of the last activity in it (if it is a thread). A material has a so-called goal of reading; it could be, for example, to understand the piece of text that a reference to the material has been encountered within.

**Rules of choosing sources and materials**

- Sources may contain all kinds of materials (books, on-line/video courses, stationary courses etc.).
- Most of the time, I have tried to choose only materials that are (for the time of finding): free, available online (i.e., in whole), non-interactive (i.e., which do not require to write code while learning), not videos, not podcasts and not stationary courses.

**Labels and formatting that a material and a source may be described by**

- `to-be-read` – no piece of information in the material has been assessed as useful until now, but at least one section from the material has not yet been read.
- `in-reading` – either 1) the reading of the material has been started and has not been finished yet, or 2) the material is meant to be read in the first place. If there are more than one material with the status `in-reading`, that means that all of them are related and shall be read "most possibly one after another". In case of a video material, a time in parentheses may follow the label `in-reading` (`in-reading ({time})`); if that is the case, the time denotes the moment of the video that the watching of it has been stopped, and that the next time the video is to be resumed at.
- `to-be-used` – some or all of the information of the material has been assessed as useful in the future. Materials with the status `to-be-used` may also have the status `used`.
- `used` – some or all of the information of the material has been used. Materials with the status `used` may also have the status `to-be-used`.
- `not-suitable` – no information from the material has not been yet used and assessed as useful in the future; the material is mentioned only to avoid the mistake of reading it for the second time.
- `partially-read` – the material has been read only in that its part in that it has been assessed as appropriate to the goal of reading (and the rest of it is not planned to be read in the future; it could be read, but is not required to).
- Strikethrough (example: ~~strikethrough~~) – the material contains information that initially has been assessed as useful, but after reading, the whole material has been assessed as not useful. Its reading has been started, but has not been finished.

### The list of sources and materials related INDIRECTLY to my learning

The following list represents a more restricted set that the one represented by the list above; this one does not contain sources that I have not used.

A material on this list may contain an additional (to the above list) label `read` which means that the material has been read, but also has been assessed to be useful only "theoretically"; that is, this material is not to be mentioned in other articles from this series. By "having read a material", I mean having read all of the sections of the material beside those sections of which any:
1. is "considerably not enough appropriate" to the goal of reading of the material;
2. and/or in its majority, consists of information mistaken or seeming to be mistaken;
3. and/or in its majority, consists of information that I am "enough unsure" of;
4. and/or is written/formatted in a form that prevents sufficient understanding, assessing its correctness, or assessing how I am sure of it.
