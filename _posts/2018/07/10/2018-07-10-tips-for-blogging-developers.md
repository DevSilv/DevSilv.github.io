This article contains tips for bloggers that are developers (programmers, or testers, or similar) on how to create a good article.

## Four disclaimers before we start

**I consider the below tips as "tips".** They are my opinion and you should not treat it as requirements nor expectations. It is always up to you to follow them or not.

**This article is not intended to be a manual or a guide.** In case of any doubts, prior to this article one should refer to standards, normative documents or regulatory documents of any described concepts.

**This article is not intended to be comprehensive on any subject**, especially neither on writing blogs nor programming. I might have forget about some important things or aspects of things, or just missed them when reading various documentations. Additionally, there might be cases that I did not forget about a thing being important **objectively**, but not decided to describe it because I have not found it important **subjectively**.

Lastly, **please be aware that I am not an expert in blogging, developing software nor programming.** I might have made typos, mistakes and errors describing the subject (although I tried not to make any).

## Introduction

 I wrote this article, because I read a lot (I think so) of articles online – much of them talking about programming and code, or just being more or less technical. However, I see that some of them break some rules that I would like them to hold. Consequently, I have decided to verbalize and write down these rules. I assume that they may be helpful for some people.

In the tips, I am assuming that **one** is writing **an article**. This article will then be read by some **readers**. It may contain **text** and optional **code**, **images**, **videos** and **links**. If the is code provided, it means for me that one usually split it into **listings**. The article should have **the primary subject** (== the subject), and may have some **secondary subjects**. Both one **describes** or **writes about them** in the article.

Generally, it should not matter what language is used.

**Remember, these tips may not fit all kinds of articles that you write / you want to write. If you are not familiar with some of them, you can make [an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/) in [this project](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss.github.io) on GitHub. Also, if you find any contradictions between any rules, you can make an issue on that.**

The tips are not written in any particular order, but I have tried to put some of the most important first.

## The tips

### 1. Write shortly.

It is perhaps widely known tip, not only in the case of blogging. But, let us concentrate particularly on a blog's article. Readers of your article may fulfil one or more of the following conditions:
1. The language of the article is not the language that they speak natively;
2. they may want to read the article, but be tired;
3. they may **not** want to read the article, but have to for some reason.

Therefore, be conscious that:
- **In case of a long sentence** (I often write them), the readers might lost the context of it.
- **In case of a long paragraph**, the readers might lost the context of it, the meaning of the current topic or the topic as a whole.
- **In case of a long listing**, the readers might not understand what it shows (what the code illustrates), or they might lost the way how it is related to the issue or subject that it illustrates (see also the tip no. 3 below about illustrating).

Consequently, to avoid that, try to write succinctly. If an issue is too complex for a short sentence, paragraph or listing, just provide more sentences, paragraphs and listings.

### 2. Do not treat superficially anything that is more advanced than basics.

When you treat something in such a way, be aware there are two cases:
- **The readers might think that they should know the described thing** – in this case, they may get confused if they do not know it (as I often do).
- **The readers might think that the described thing is not important** – in this case, they may be mistaken if it is.

### 3. Code, images, videos and links should only illustrate a subject, not describe it.

If code, images, videos or links seem to **be as important, or more important** than text, then maybe there is too little text. If code, images, videos or links seem to **describe** text, maybe you should split it into more articles.

### 4. Code, images, videos and links should be as difficult as text.

Code (or an image, a video, or a link) that is more difficult than text will make the readers **confused**; if it is easier than text, it could make the readers **wrong**.

### 5. Examples, examples, examples.

Probably it is widely know tip, but let me remind: the examples are places where the readers might compare the author's ideas with their own, practical world. In case you there is a limit of words and there is available space yet, or a description just lacks something for you – provide an example. Usually, the more examples is provided, the more the readers will understand.

### 6. Examples should speak for themselves.

If you provide examples, try to keep them accurate – and if you cannot, tell the readers about it. A poor example **with** an indication that it is poor is better than no example. And no example is better than a poor example **without** an indication that it is poor.

### 7. Comparisons are good.

Examples are a very good way to help the readers understand the subject. But, it is also useful to compare the subject's issues or topics described in your article to the issues or topics described in other articles. They may be available on the internet, or in a printed book, or any other way that one can read them. If you suppose that readers in general do not know those articles that you could provide, see below the tip 15 about leaving your blog.

Usually, the comparison may be done just by providing a link or two (remember about the descriptions of links), but occasionally it may be better to write a whole paragraph about it.

### 8. Readers should try to understand the article's subject, not the article itself.

Someone said that simple problems described in a complex way become complex. It is always good to write simple, clear and short sentences, paragraphs and listings – no matter that you are either describing the basics, or an advanced topic. [Maybe Albert Einstein **did not say** "if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8742/did-einstein-say-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont-understand-it-well-en), but personally I find this rule OK and try to achieve that level of explanation.

### 9. Reasons, reasons, reasons.

This tip is loosely related to the previous tip 8 about understanding the subject: readers should understand, why something is introduced in the article. Therefore, wherever possible, explain why you wrote something. Provide reasons, causes and motives both for all of the most difficult ideas and for the simplest. If you cannot, that might mean that you should create a new article describing this thing.

### 10. Try to use phrases like "whatever the case", "it does not matter" or "you should not care" only when necessary.

All of these phrases may mean that the readers should treat the words before (or after) them as **less important** that they might have seemed to them. It may cause the readers to get confused.

Generally, it may be helpful to imagine such a relationship: you know when to consider a term or a concept less important that it seems to be, but the readers do not know it yet. See also the tip 15 about leaving your blog.

### 11. Keep YAGNI.

For those who does not know YAGNI, it is an acronym of ["You Aren't Gonna Need It"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it), a principle of [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming). It denotes that you should not introduce new functionality (e.g. to a program) until it is necessary. In terms of blogging, it may be understood as: do not describe subjects, topics, issues, aspects or cases that are not related somehow to the main subject. If you cannot relate something to the main subject, or even to a secondary subject, that might mean that you should create a new article describing this thing.

### 12. If you describe several issues, mind the proportions.

If the article discusses several issues of the main subject, try to keep proportions in the length of their descriptions. For example, if the first and the second issue are described in one paragraph each, try to include the third and fourth in no more than three each. Otherwise, some issues may seem to be more important, just because you described them in a more extensive way.

### 13. Choose the words that you already use.

If the article is just a more or less technical document, I find it better to repeat a word four times than to provide four different words instead, each describing the same concept, but having slightly different collocations or meaning. Of course, there are articles intended to be written using literary language, and probably those should not be changed. In any case, remember about readers whose native language is different from the article's language.

### 14. Be consistent when telling the readers what is right.

If the first paragraph tells the readers "You should do X", and the latter "You have to do X", they will be **confused**. In the opposite case, if firstly comes "You have to", and then "You should", they could be **mistaken**.

### 15. Do not **demand** from the readers to leave your blog.

Among other things, readers may want to leave your blog when they do not understand something or they lack of some information. By "leave the blog" I mean to abandon reading the current article in favor of e.g. looking into a dictionary. Try not to demand it from them; leave it to their own decision, maybe encourage them. In order to do this, you may try to fulfil the following points:
- **Inform the readers whether the subject you describe is up-to-date**, e.g. if it is something changing fast, like a library. Particularly, inform them about (1) the version that you describe, and (2) whether this version is up-to-date. Make it clear if it is not.
- **Assume that readers know only the basics**. If you have to assume that they have any advanced knowledge about the subject, then mention it in the introduction (so that anybody who do not have the proper knowledge may exit early).
- **Assume that this article is the first that the readers read on this subject.** Inform the readers whether the subject is already widely discussed (in the internet, in books and the like) and summarize it (as far as you can). If it would be too much information, provide links.

### 16. Code, images, videos and links rarely speak for themselves.

If there is not provided a description for a thing, the readers may lost the context of it. Always provide an explanation for a listing, an image, a video and a link, if this listing, etc., helps understand the subject. Use even a more extensive comment or caption. Generally, if it is not a description, but it is used instead of text, it probably need one.

### 17. Enumerate cautiously.

If you write "firstly", try not to change the "secondly" for "next", or "later" or similar – otherwise the readers will get lost. To avoid your own mistakes and readers' misunderstanding: if it is turning out to be more than three points, enumerate them by numbers instead of words (maybe starting each from a new line).

### 18. Cautiously use phrases like "but", "however", "instead" or "although".

If you write two expressions and join them with one of these words, readers usually expect two things at once:
1. both expressions deal with the same subject (not to be confused with the main and secondary subjects of the whole article);
2. the second expression will be in contradiction with the first.

You may write the expressions in one sentence, but you may also create two separate sentences. Whichever the case, consider that:
- if you write the first expression not **directly** after the other (i.e. you split it with another one), the readers might get confused – because they might see the contradiction weaker than you meant it to be;
- if you add a third expression **in contradiction to both or even one of them**, the readers might get confused – because they might not know what to contrapose to what.

### 19. Cautiously use phrases like "may", "might", "can", "could", "must" and "have to".

It may seem that there is nothing wrong with these phrases, but they are often confusing in terms of technical description. I find it most useful to use them as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

_**Tip:** if you are not aware of what RFC (Request for Comments) is, see [Wikipedia's article about RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)._

### 20. Cautiously use phrases like "believe", "want to" and "seem".

This tip is similar to the previous one: you may see nothing wrong with these phrases, but I think that they are often confusing in terms of technical description.

There are generally two "subjects" that you can relate these phrases to: (1) you and (2) other people.

If you speak about yourself, remember that the readers may believe or desire, or something may seem to them differently than you believe, desire and something seems to you.

If you speak about other people:
- **If you write "it is believed"**, you probably want to say "they say so, but I am not sure". But, be careful whether this does not start to mean "nobody is sure, but they say so".
- **If you write "somebody wanted to do something"**, you probably want to say "somebody did something". But, be careful whether this does not start to mean "somebody wanted to do something, but nobody can say whether they really did".
- **If you write "it seems to be"**, you probably want to say "I think it is, and you can think so, but I am not sure". But, be careful whether this does not start to mean "I think it is, but I am not sure, so you should _not_ think it is".

### 21. A note about "-" (or "–", or "—").

The characters: "-" (hypen<sup>1</sup>), "–" (en dash<sup>2</sup>) and "—" (em dash<sup>3</sup>) are commonly used (among other uses) to denote a part of a sentence which is separated from the rest of it. Consequently, if you write one of those character in a sentence, the readers may presume one of two things:
1. The current thought (or expression, or clause) is the last in the sentence (e.g. `Blah blah – thought.`).
2. The current thought (or expression, or clause) will be followed by another same character (e.g. `Blah blah – thought – blah blah.`).

And suppose you wanted to put two characters, but forgot it somehow and put only the first. So now, the readers may assume one of two things:
- The current thought (or expression, or clause) is **the last in the sentence** – and while it is not true, the readers will be mistaken.
- The current thought (or expression, or clause) is **incomplete** – which does not always mean that the readers will be mistaken, but always means that they will be confused.

_**Tip:** if you are not aware of when to use which of the aforementioned character, see this [Wikipedia's guide on hyphens and dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hyphens_and_dashes), and also articles about [hypens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen) and [dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash)._

### 22. Differentiate all the cases that you describe.

If a subject, an issue or a topic has several possibilities to choose from, inform the reader whether they may be considered as equivalent. If not, make it clear what are the differences and when to use which.

For example, if your article describe a new programming language, and the language has several use cases, ask yourself (and/or inform the readers) about the following things:
- How many of the use cases are you describing? (provide the highest exact number that you can)
- Are there any other use cases that you are not describing? (tell how many if you can)
- May there be any other use cases that you do not know yet about? Might there be in the past any other that you do not know yet about? May there appear new ones in the future?
- Which of all the use cases (those described by you and those not) are similar? Which of them are different? (these are two separate questions)
- Why to choose this language in which of them?
- Even if they are different, could the language play the same role in them?

### 23. Try not to mix abstract terms and notions with concrete ones.

If possible, it seems to be better to make some explicit distinction between the abstract notions and terms and the concrete ones. For example, if a paragraph describes a topic in a high-level way, inform the readers why the next paragraph is describing the same topic in a more concrete way.

### 24. Try to describe the background of the subject.

This tip is loosely related to the previous tip 5 about giving examples. It might be especially useful in case when the article describes a "new" subject (e.g. a new concept, a recently/currently published specification, a recently created software, a recently established company etc.).

Most probably, the background of a subject may involve:
- its history;
- if it has been created (e.g. it is a product) – reasons for creating;
- reasons, for which one decided to describe it;
- other subjects that are related to it.

For example, if the article is to introduce a new JavaScript library (which is a created thing), the above points would be as follows:
- What are its "main dates" – either: (1) since one starts to inventing it, (2) since it has been created, or at least (3) since it has been published? Who are its authors? Who are its maintainers? Who has been owning it? Do they still own it? Was the libary earlier proprietary, and it has become open-source currently (or vice versa)? If so, why?
- What are the reasons, for which it has been created? Are there already similar libraries available? Then, why did one not choose to use them, and instead created a new library?
- Why one describes it? Would it not be better to describe another library?
- Are there already similar libraries available? If so, what are their names? In what ways are they similar?

### 25. Try to describe the background of the article.

One should try to describe the background of an article, to let readers better understand it – specifically if the article was updated, or is part of an article series.

Most probably, the background of an article may involve:
- its authors;
- its publish date;
- its classification – if relevant (e.g. based on the subject and in the form of keywords);
- reasons for creating;
- history of its updates – the times that it was being updated, and optionally some description what was updated in mentioned updates;
- other articles that are intentionally related to it, if relevant (e.g., the article may be part of an article series on the subject).

### 26. If it fits the style and the subject of your article, make references.

I find that explicit references help me connect things – and therefore understand them.

That is, for example, imagine that two paragraphs talk about one subject: about hardware. But each of them talks about different thing within this subject: the first about the processor, and the next about the RAM. In such a situation, if I saw in the paragraph about the RAM a reference to the paragraph about the processor, I would find it easier to see that both the processor and RAM belong to the same subject, the hardware. Such a reference may look like this: "Next, we are going to talk about another hardware component..."

Such references may be made not only from a paragraph to a paragraph. They may also be made:
- between two concepts in one sentence, e.g. using "but" or "whereas";
- between two sentences, e.g. using "they" or "the aforementioned...";
- between two sections of the article, e.g. by "While/Since in the previous section we talked about...";
- or between your article and another one, e.g. by "The article X talked about Y. Now, we are going to talk about the same things, but from another perspective..."
