TOREAD: Wikipedia -> learning theory

In this article, I want to present a list of things that I think readers of an article might learn by reading.

## Disclaimer 

The article contains mostly my own observations. They may be not comprehensive, or even invalid in a general case. Please be aware that I'm not an expert in the field that this article is describing. In case of any doubts, prior to this article refer to official or generally accepted definitions and descriptions of particular concepts and ideas.

## Preface

In the article, the term "article" is understood as a type of written work, as defined in [[1]](#1). Nonetheless, it's not excluded that the described things may be referred to other types of written works, in this or that way.

## The things

1. **Media.** Readers learn how to use the media through which the article is provided. If they already know how to use it, they improve their skills by repetition/recalling.
2. **Terminology.** Readers learn new terminology that the article is using. If they already know the terminology, they improve their knowledge by repetition/recalling.
3. **Vocabulary / language.** Readers learn new vocabulary (the language) that the article is using. If they already know the vocabulary, they improve their knowledge by repetition/recalling.
4. **Subject.** Readers learn new subject that the article describes. If they already know it, they improve their knowledge by repetition/recalling.
5. **Patience.** Readers improve their patience, if the article demands more patience than they already have.
6. **Perceptiveness.** Readers improve their perceptiveness, if the article demands more perceptiveness than they already have.
7. **Concentration.** Readers improve their concentration, if the article demands more concentration than they already have.
8. **Writing.** Readers learn new way of writing an article. If they already know this way, they improve their skills by repetition/recalling.
9. **Organizing knowledge.** Readers learn new ways of organizing their knowledge. If they already know them, they improve their skills by repetition/recalling.
10. **Describing the world.** Readers learn new ways of describing the world. This is on the assumption that they somewhat incorporate the model that they create reading this article to the model of the world that they already have. If they already know these ways, they improve their skills by repetition/recalling.
