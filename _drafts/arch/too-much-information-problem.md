In this article, I want to share my observations (maybe also concerns) on the amount of information that we nowadays encounter in the context of learning. I would like to concentrate on the internet, but will describe also some other fields.

## Three disclaimers before we start

**This article is intended only to show my thoughts on information nowadays.** It is not intended to be an account, a report, a guide, nor to contain any tips. In case of any doubts, prior to this article one should refer to their knowledge, experience or to another information that are available to them.

**This article is not intended to be comprehensive on any subject**, especially neither on information, theory of information nor the internet. I might have forget about some important things or aspects of things, or just missed them when reading various documentations. Additionally, there might be cases that I did not forget about a thing being important **objectively**, but not decided to describe it because I have not found it important **subjectively**.

Lastly, **please be aware that I am not an expert in theory of information or in the field of the internet.** I might have made mistakes, errors and typos describing the subject (although I tried not to make any).

## Necessary definitions

### Who are "we"?

I can think of two ways of expressing the subject in the dependent clause of the verbless sentence "information that we encounter" ("we" is the subject):
1. "we" as a literal, collective "we" (a group of people, determined by each one being identifying with this group);
2. "we" as "each one, each of us independently".

In this article, I have chosen to use the second meaning. I think that it would also be possible to choose the first one instead. But in such case I do not know how significantly one would need to change this article (to make it conformed with this choice).

### What is "information"?

I think that the term "information" is pretty well understood in the context of this article the same by everybody. But as one can find on the internet a couple of definitions of it (e.g. on Wikipedia, Merriam-Webster or TechTarget), it may need some clarification in the context of this article.

Not to complicate, by "information" I understand the whole or part of: written works (including words, articles, websites, magazines, books, [knowledge bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base), databases, data sets, [RSSes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS), software documentation and source code), recorded or not recorded audio (including human and non-human speech and sounds), videos (including TV and streaming), signals (including radio and smoke signals), smells, [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) and similar things that can be touched, seen, read, heard, smell or in other way assimilated/received by a human, or a thing that they use or may be able to use (e.g. a device).

Well, in fact, according to this definition of mine, one may presumably think of e.g. a building or an ocean as information. That is true â€“ in the context of this article, I would consider them as information, too, since, for example, a building can be seen and touched, and an ocean smelled and heard.
